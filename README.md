# Tesseract_Comparison
    • In this repository I have compared the result of existing Tesseract and Customized Refined Tesseract
    • Here at first I take a 55 images and upload in google drive and open with google docs to extract actual text then manually arrange some text according to the given images. Link for the data :- https://github.com/treeleafrnd/Tesseract_Comparison/tree/master/data
    link for actual text :- https://github.com/treeleafrnd/Tesseract_Comparison/tree/master/actual_text
    • Then I extract the Nepali text of images from existing tesseract using nep.trained model. 
    Link for extracted texts :- https://github.com/treeleafrnd/Tesseract_Comparison/tree/master/existing_tesseract
    • Then I extract the Nepali text of images from Customized Refined Teesseract using Kalimati.trained and Mangal.trained model.
    Link for the text :- https://github.com/treeleafrnd/Tesseract_Comparison/tree/master/refined_tesseract
    • And then from this above extracted text I compared the result between Existing Tesseract and Refined Tesseract.
    • Finally I created a Evaluation Report from this comparison and concluded that Refined Tesseract can extract text more accurately than Existing Tesseract. Link for the evaluation report :- https://github.com/treeleafrnd/Tesseract_Comparison/blob/master/tesseract_evaluation_report.ods
